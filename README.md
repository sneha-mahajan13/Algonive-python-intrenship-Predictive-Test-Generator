This project is a Python-based text-predicting generator.
It uses a straightforward word-frequency model to anticipate the next potential word based on previously learnt material.
The project is created as a component of an internship assignment, with an emphasis on:
Python programming
Preprocessing of text
Fundamental ideas in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Features
 uses information to predict the following word.
 enables users to dynamically add unique sentences
continuously learns from fresh information
automatically cleans and preprocesses text
 Command-line interface with a menu
Technologies Python 3 re (Regular Expressions) collections (Counter, defaultdict) were utilized.
Simple NLP reasoning
